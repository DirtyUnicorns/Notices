# Recruiting #
---
These requirements are for developers that want to apply to become device maintainers or for general developer "status" but don't know what's expected of them or may have questions about how our project differs from others.
---

This guide assumes that the developers applying already know how to sync and compile Android, and have a basic understanding of linux. If
the developers applying don't have a basic understanding of linux and Android, please don't bother applying.
