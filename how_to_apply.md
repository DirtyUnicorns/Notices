__How to apply__
---

1. Before contacting anyone on the committee, ALL of the requirements for either maintainer or developer must be met. If there are any questions regarding them, you can reach out but maintainership will not be considered without meeting the requirements.

2. Contact one of the committee members using either on Telegram. When contacting the committee, you should link your personal GitHub and/or device specific repos (if applying for maintainer) and explain why you think you should be a DU developer/maintainer. Think of this like a job application, the information should be provided before coming in for an interview.

3. __DO NOT SPAM__ the committee members. They all have real lives and can get busy.
