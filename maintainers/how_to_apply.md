__How to apply for maintainership__
---

1. Before contacting anyone on the committee, ALL of [the requirements](requirements.md) must be met. If there are any questions regarding them, you can reach out but maintainership will not be considered without meeting the requirements.

2. Contact one of the committee members using either Google+ or Telegram. When contacting the committee, you should link your device specific repos and explain why you think you should be a maintainer. This is like a job application, the information should be provided before coming in for an interview.

3. __DO NOT SPAM__ the committee members. They all have real lives and can get busy.
